Instructions on how to use the Access database: (Access 2013, may be different from previous versions)

Note: In order for this Access database to work properly, You must fill out the player table. The Player field is where you put the profile name that you will be using for each player in the BattleTag software. Once you include both the Profile Name and Full Name of each person that will be playing, copy all the records in the player table to the victim table. 

1. Go to External Data, Text File. Select the file name to import. 
2. Select append a copy of the records to the table: Scores. Click OK. 
3. Make sure Delimited is selected and then click Next.
4. Check First Row Contains Field Names. 
5. Keep clicking next to finish the import. Important: If you get an error message saying that any records were deleted due to key violations, it means that at least one profile name does not exist in the player table.
